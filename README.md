### Screen mockups

The app was prototyped using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/CgwDsn1tYo8YffaNimjVfq/IFCS-HelloWorld?node-id=0-1&t=fSJk46k665IlDYDs-1).

### Code Design

The code design is summarised in the class diagram below.

The `HelloName` class inherits from the `tk.Tk` class, which provides the foundational GUI window functionality. This inheritance allows `HelloName` to use and extend the methods and attributes of `tk.Tk` to create a customised application window with specific features for user interaction and input validation.
